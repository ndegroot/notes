# Publish your Obsidian note

Using the great plugin https://github.com/jobindj/obsidian-publish-mkdocs it's easy to publish your notes. It uses GitHub, so it's a little developer oriented, but it's not that complex.

# What you need to do
- Add the plugin in Obsidian
- Follow the directions above 
- Create your free GitHub account
- Install a git tool and learn a little about git [here](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) you can skip step 5, 8 and 9
- (in short: 
  inside your new Obsidian folder (= your local repo):
	  - git add . (collect your changes)
	  - git commit -m "update" (or use other text)
	  - git push (send you changes to your GitHub repo) 
	  - (your changes are - after a short time - published at https:<your github username>.github.io/<reponame>/<foldername>)
To be able to use images in your posts, move your 'attachments' folder _inside_ Security risk: yu don't want to upload all your attachments to GitHub. Only add the images you really need in your published notes
